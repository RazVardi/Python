If we want to build student management software (or college) then as part of writing our code we will need to define a student class.
- Define a student's class and define the following characteristics in the class:
1. Name
2. Enamel
3. Add 3 more features of your choice
4. An array of his score list
Create methods according to the next step (see what you need and accordingly create appropriate methods)
Then:
Create 5 different students
2. Print all the details about each student using toString
3. Print for each student the average of his or her grades
4. Print the grade point average of all students together
